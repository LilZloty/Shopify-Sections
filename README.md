My goal is to create a Shopify sections repo where we share sections that work on Shopify 2.0. 
I will drop all types of sections I developed here, and you can use them for free on Shopify. 
There are always some CSS properties/js, that you need to change based on your theme. 

Most of the sections work on the Dawn theme and Shopify 2.0. 
But you can re-use them on different themes that use Shopify 2.0. 
Feel free to use and modify them and share with us what you did too so we can share and gain some time.
